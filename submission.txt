Team Name: monikabhati2005
Hackathon: BrainDead 2K26

=== PROBLEM STATEMENT 1: ReelSense ===
Repository: https://github.com/monikabhati2005/PS_1_ReelSense
Report: BrainDead_Hackathon_Report.pdf
Demo: Interactive console output with explainable recommendations

Key Files:
- src/reelsense/main.py: Complete execution pipeline
- outputs/evaluation_results.csv: Performance metrics
- outputs/visualizations/: EDA charts and metrics plots

=== PROBLEM STATEMENT 2: Cognitive Radiology Assistant ===
Repository: https://github.com/monikabhati2005/PS_2_Cognitive_Radiology_Report
Model Checkpoint: [TO BE ADDED - Upload trained weights to Google Drive/Dropbox/Mega]
Report: BrainDead_Hackathon_Report.pdf
Demo Video: [TO BE ADDED - 2-minute screencast showing X-ray → Report generation]

Key Files:
- models/encoder.py: PRO-FA (Progressive Feature Alignment)
- models/classifier.py: MIX-MLP (Multi-task Knowledge-Enhanced MLP)
- models/attention.py: RCTA (Recursive Cognitive Triangular Attention)
- models/cognitive_model.py: Complete integrated model
- training/train.py: Training pipeline
- scripts/gui_app.py: Interactive GUI demo application

Implementation Notes:
- All 3 mandatory modules (PRO-FA, MIX-MLP, RCTA) fully implemented
- Training verified on P100 GPU (Kaggle environment)
- GUI with advanced animations for professional demo
- Evaluation framework ready for CheXpert F1, RadGraph F1, CIDEr metrics

Next Steps for Submission:
1. Upload trained model checkpoint to cloud storage
2. Record 2-minute demo video showing:
   - Loading X-ray image
   - Model inference with visual feedback
   - Generated diagnostic report display
3. Update checkpoint link and video link in this file
4. Push codebases to public GitHub repositories
